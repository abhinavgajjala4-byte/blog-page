                <p>Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that
                    enables computers to learn from data and make decisions
                    without being explicitly programmed for every task. It involves
                    training algorithms on data to identify patterns, which allows them
                    to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. Key concepts
                    include different learning types like supervised, unsupervised, and
                    reinforcement
                    learning, as well as the importance of data and model training. </p>
